===================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-export-dataset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-export-dataset)

Export an EASY dataset to a Staged Digital Object set.


SYNOPSIS
--------

    easy-export-dataset <dataset-pid> <staged-digital-object-set>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Exports an EASY dataset from one repository to a [Staged Digital Object set] which can be [imported] into another EASY Fedora Commons 3.x Repository. 

All the digital objects belonging to the dataset are 
exported, including: the dataset, all file and folder items, download history and jump-off pages. If `dataset-pid`
is not present in the Fedora repository or `stage-digital-object-set` cannot be created (e.g., it already exists)
the program terminates with an error.

Objects belonging to the dataset are selectied via the relation `isSubordinateTo`.
For each digital object the last version of each (managed) datastream, a `fo.xml` and `cfg.json` file are downloaded.
The `fo.xml` file includes the inline datastreams except `RELS_EXT`
which is exported into to the "relations"-map in the file `cfg.json` ([Digital Object Configuration]).
Fedora PIDs in this file that reference downloaded objects are replaced by the appropriate SDO-name.

Checksums and PIDs of downloaded objects are removed from the downloaded `fo.xml`.
For that purpose the following components are removed:

* Any element who's content equals the id of one of the downloaded objects,
* The attribute PID in the element `<foxml:digitalObject>`
* The attribute DIGEST in the element `<foxml:contentDigest>`


ARGUMENTS
---------

     -p, --fcrepo-password  <arg>   Password for fcrepo-user
     -f, --fcrepo-server  <arg>     URL of Fedora Commons Repository Server to connect to
     -u, --fcrepo-user  <arg>       User to connect to fcrepo-server
         --help                     Show help message
         --version                  Show version of this program
    
    trailing arguments:
     dataset-pid (required)                 The id of a dataset in the fedora repository
     staged-digital-object-set (required)   The resulting Staged Digital Object directory that will be created.




INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------

### Installation steps:

1. Unzip the tarball to a directory of your choice, e.g. `/opt/`
2. A new directory called `easy-export-dataset-<version>` will be created (referred to as `$APPHOME` in the following)
3. Create a symbolic link to `$APPHOME/bin/easy-export-dataset` at `/usr/bin/easy-export-dataset` (or at some other
   location that is on the `PATH`. 

 
### Configuration:

Configuration settings must be specified in `$APPHOME/cfg/application.properties`. These include the connection 
settings for Fedora and for the File-system RDB. Command line arguments can override this configuration.
